# [2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies/)
### `Medium`

You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the `i^th` bag. You are also given an integer `k` that denotes the number of children to distribute **all**  the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.

The **unfairness**  of a distribution is defined as the **maximum**  **total**  cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return the **minimum**  unfairness of all distributions.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2
Output: 31
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]
- The 1^st child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.
- The 2^nd child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: cookies = [6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [6,1], [3,2,2], and [4,1,2]
- The 1^st child receives [6,1] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.
- The 2^nd child receives [3,2,2] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.
- The 3^rd child receives [4,1,2] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `2 <= cookies.length <= 8`
- `1 <= cookies[i] <= 10^5`
- `2 <= k <= cookies.length`

**Solution:**

```CPP

    #define DEV if (false)
    #define DEB(X) DEV cout << __LINE__ << '\t' << #X << '\t' << X << endl;
    #define DEBVEC(X) DEV { cout << __LINE__ << '\t' << #X << "\t"; for (int i = 0; i < X.size(); i++) cout << X[i] << '\t'; cout << endl; }
    #define DEBS(X) DEV { cout << __LINE__ << '\t' << X << endl; }

    /* Checks if given vector is already present in memory

     * @return INT_MIN if not present
     */
    int alreadyPresent(vector<int> v) {
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());
        if (memory.find(v) != memory.end()) {
            return memory[v];
        }
        return INT_MIN;
    }

    /* Adds a new key value pair to memory
     * @param v key vector
     * @param val value of the vector key
     */
    void addHash(vector<int> v, int val) {
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());
        memory[v] = val;
    }

    Solution() {
        dist = vector<int>(8, 0);
    }

     */
    int distributeCookies(vector<int>& cookies, int k, int idx = 0) {
        DEB(idx) DEBVEC(dist)
        int n = cookies.size(), ans = INT_MAX;

        if (idx == n) {
            return *max_element(dist.begin(), dist.end());
        }

        int calculated = alreadyPresent(dist);

        if (calculated != INT_MIN) {
            DEBS("FROM DP")
            return calculated;
        }
        
        // Backtracking the solution
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            dist[i] += cookies[idx];
            ans = min(ans, distributeCookies(cookies, k, idx + 1));
            dist[i] -= cookies[idx];
        } 

        addHash(dist, ans);

        return ans;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**
- The time complexity of the `distributeCookies()` function can be analyzed as follows:
  - Let `n` be the number of bags (length of the `cookies` vector).
  - Let `k` be the number of children.
  - The function utilizes a recursive approach with backtracking to check all possible distributions.
  - In the worst case, each cookie can be assigned to any of the `k` children, resulting in a branching factor of `k` at each recursive call.
  - Since there are `n` cookies, the recursion depth can be at most `n`.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is `O(k^n)`.

**Explanation:**
- The given code aims to find the minimum unfairness in distributing cookies among children using a recursive approach with backtracking and memoization.
- The `distributeCookies()` function takes the vector `cookies` and the number of children `k` as input and returns the minimum unfairness.
- The function maintains a vector `dist` to keep track of the number of cookies assigned to each child.
- The function starts with `idx = 0` (the current index of the cookies array) and iterates over all possible distributions by assigning cookies to each child and recursively exploring further distributions.
- The base case is reached when all cookies have been assigned (when `idx` reaches `n`).


- At each recursive call, the function checks if the current distribution has been previously calculated using memoization. If so, it retrieves the result from the memory.
- Otherwise, it iterates over each child and assigns the cookie at index `idx` to that child. It then recursively calls the function to explore further distributions.
- After the recursive call, the function backtracks by subtracting the assigned cookie from the child to explore other possibilities.
- Finally, the minimum unfairness (the maximum total cookies obtained by a single child) is returned as the result.
- The code includes debug statements (`DEV`, `DEB`, `DEBVEC`, `DEBS`) to print debug information if the `DEV` flag is set to true.
- The code uses a map `memory` to store previously calculated distributions to avoid redundant calculations.
- The `alreadyPresent()` function checks if a distribution is already present in the memory and returns the result if found.
- The `addHash()` function adds a distribution and its corresponding result to the memory.
- The `Solution` class initializes the `dist` vector with all elements set to 0 in the constructor.
- Overall, the code explores all possible distributions using backtracking and memoization to find the minimum unfairness in distributing the cookies.
