# [1601. Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-achievable-transfer-requests/description/)
### `Hard`

We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `from<sub>i</sub>` to building `to<sub>i</sub>`.

**All buildings are full** , so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero** . This means the number of employees **leaving**  is **equal**  to the number of employees **moving in** . For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return the maximum number of achievable requests.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move1.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 406px;">

```
Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
Output: 5
**Explantion:**  Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
From building 4 we don't have any requests.
We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move2.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 327px;">

```
Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 3
**Explantion:**  Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
We can achieve all the requests. 
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
- `requests[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub> < n`

**Solution:**

```CPP
class Solution {
    int maximumRequests(int n, vector<vector<int>>& requests, vector<int>& diff, int idx = 0) {
        // Base case: all requests have been processed
        if (idx == requests.size()) {
            // Check if the net change in employee transfers is zero
            if (*max_element(diff.begin(), diff.end()) == 0) {
                return 0;
            }
            return INT_MIN; // If the net change is not zero, this is an invalid request configuration
        }

        // Perform the transfer: decrement from the "from" building and increment in the "to" building
        diff[requests[idx][0]] -= 1;
        diff[requests[idx][1]] += 1;

        // Recursive call considering the current request
        int select = 1 + maximumRequests(n, requests, diff, idx + 1);

        // Undo the transfer: increment in the "from" building and decrement in the "to" building
        diff[requests[idx][0]] += 1;
        diff[requests[idx][1]] -= 1;

        // Recursive call without considering the current request
        int notselect = maximumRequests(n, requests, diff, idx + 1);

        // Return the maximum of selecting and not selecting the current request
        return max(select, notselect);
    }

public:
    /**
     * Calculate the maximum number of achievable requests given the buildings and requests.
     *
     * @param n        The number of buildings.
     * @param requests The list of transfer requests.
     * @return         The maximum number of achievable requests.
     */
    int maximumRequests(int n, vector<vector<int>>& requests) {
        // Initialize the difference array to keep track of the net change in employee transfers
        vector<int> diff(n, 0);
        // Call the recursive function with initial values
        return maximumRequests(n, requests, diff, 0);
    }
};
```

Complexity:
- Let `n` be the number of buildings and `r` be the number of requests.
- The time complexity of the `maximumRequests()` function is O(2^r * n), where 2^r is the number of subsets of requests and n is the time taken to check the net change in employee transfers.
- The space complexity is O(n) for the difference array.

Explanation:
- The given code calculates the maximum number of achievable requests given the buildings and requests.
- The `maximumRequests()` function takes the number of buildings `n`, the list of transfer requests `requests`, and a difference array `diff` as input and returns the maximum number of achievable requests.
- The function uses recursive backtracking to explore all possible combinations of requests.
- It starts with an index `idx` set to 0, which represents the current request being considered.
- The base case is when all requests have been processed. In this case, it checks if the net change in employee transfers is zero by finding the maximum element in the `diff` array. If the net change is zero, it means the requests are achievable, and it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns INT_MIN to indicate an invalid request configuration.
- For each request, the function performs the transfer by decrementing the employee count in the "from" building and incrementing it in the "to" building. It then makes a recursive call with the next index `idx + 1` to process the remaining requests.
- After the recursive call, it undoes the transfer by incrementing the employee count in the "from" building and decrementing it in the "to" building. This allows exploring the possibility of not selecting the current

 request.
- The function returns the maximum of two cases: selecting the current request (`1 + maximumRequests(...)`) and not selecting the current request (`maximumRequests(...)`).
- Finally, the function initializes the difference array `diff` with zeros and calls the recursive function `maximumRequests()` with the initial values to calculate the maximum number of achievable requests.
