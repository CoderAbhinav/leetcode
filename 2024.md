# [2024. Maximize the Confusion of an Exam](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-confusion-of-an-exam/description/)
### `Medium`

A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting true and `'F'` denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by **maximizing**  the number of **consecutive**  questions with the **same**  answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original answer to the `i^th` question. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:

- Change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'` (i.e., set `answerKey[i]` to `'T'` or `'F'`).

Return the **maximum**  number of consecutive `'T'`s or `'F'`s in the answer key after performing the operation at most `k` times.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = "TTTT".
There are four consecutive 'T's.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "FFFT".
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "TFFF".
In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = "TTTTTFTT"
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTFTTTTT". 
In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `n == answerKey.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `answerKey[i]` is either `'T'` or `'F'`
- `1 <= k <= n`

## Approach 1 - Sliding Window

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * Find the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the operation at most 'k' times.
     *
     * @param answerKey The original answer key.
     * @param k         The maximum number of times the answer key can be changed.
     * @return          The maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's.
     */
    int maxConsecutiveAnswers(string& answerKey, int k) {
        // Find the maximum number of consecutive 'T's and 'F's separately
        return max(windowOfAll(answerKey, k, 'T'), windowOfAll(answerKey, k, 'F'));
    }

private:
    /**
     * Find the maximum number of consecutive characters 'c' in the answer key after performing the operation at most 'k' times.
     *
     * @param answerKey The original answer key.
     * @param k         The maximum number of times the answer key can be changed.
     * @param c         The character 'c' to find the maximum consecutive count for.
     * @return          The maximum number of consecutive characters 'c'.
     */
    int windowOfAll(string& answerKey, int k, char c) {
        int n = answerKey.length(); // Length of the answer key
        int k_ = k; // Variable to track the remaining number of changes
        int ans = INT_MIN; // Variable to store the maximum consecutive count
        int low = 0; // Pointer for the start index of the window

        // Traverse the answer key
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (answerKey[i] == c) { // If the current character is 'c'
                if (k_ == 0) { // If all the changes have been used
                    // Move the start pointer to the next position of 'c'
                    while (answerKey[low] != c && low < i) {
                        low++;
                    }
                    low++;
                } else {
                    k_--; // Use one change
                }
            }

            // Update the maximum consecutive count
            ans = max(ans, i - low + 1);
        }

        return ans; // Return the maximum consecutive count
    }
};
```

**Approach:**
- The given code finds the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the operation at most 'k' times.
- The `maxConsecutiveAnswers()` function takes the original answer key and the maximum number of changes 'k' as parameters.
- It calls the `windowOfAll()` function twice, once for 'T' and once for 'F', and returns the maximum of the two results.
- The `windowOfAll()` function takes the original answer key, the maximum number of changes 'k', and the character 'c' as parameters.
- It initializes variables `n`, `k_`, `ans`, and `low` to store the length of the answer key, the remaining number of changes, the maximum consecutive count, and the start index of the window, respectively.
- It then iterates through the answer key and checks each character:
  - If the current character is 'c', it checks if there are any remaining changes available. If all the changes have been used, it moves the start pointer (`low`) to the next position of 'c'.
  - If there are remaining changes, it uses one change (`k_--`).
  - After each iteration, it updates the maximum consecutive count by comparing it with the current window size (`i - low + 1`).
- Finally, it returns the maximum consecutive count.

**Complexity analysis:**
- The time complexity of the code is `O(n)`, where n is the length of the answer key. This is because we iterate through the answer key only once.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we use a constant amount of extra space to store the variables.


## Approach 2 - Binary Search

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * Find the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the operation at most 'k' times.
     *
     * @param answerKey The original answer key.
     * @param k         The maximum number of times the answer key can be changed.
     * @return          The maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's.
     */
    int maxConsecutiveAnswers(string& answerKey, int k) {
        int low = 1; // The minimum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's
        int high = answerKey.size(); // The maximum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's
        int ans = INT_MIN; // Variable to store the maximum consecutive count

        // Binary search to find the maximum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2; // The length to check

            if (isValid(answerKey, k, mid)) { // Check if the current length is valid
                low = mid + 1; // Update the lower bound and store the answer
                ans = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // Update the upper bound
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the maximum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's
    }

private:
    /**
     * Check if it is possible to have a valid consecutive sequence of length 'mid' after performing at most 'k' changes.
     *
     * @param answerKey The original answer key.
     * @param k         The maximum number of times the answer key can be changed.
     * @param mid       The length to check for consecutive 'T's or 'F's.
     * @return          True if it is possible to have a valid consecutive sequence of length 'mid', otherwise False.
     */
    bool isValid(string& answerKey, int k, int mid) {
        int countOfFalse = 0; // Count of 'F's in the current window
        int countOfTrue = 0; // Count of 'T's in the current window
        int n = answerKey.size(); // Length of the answer key

        // Count the number of 'F's and 'T's in the first 'mid' characters
        for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++) {
            if (answerKey[i] == 'F') {
                countOfFalse++;
            } else {
                countOfTrue++;
            }
        }

        // Check if the number of changes needed is within the limit
        if (min(countOfFalse, countOfTrue) <= k) {
            return true;
        }

        // Move the window by one character at a time
        for (int i = 1; i < n - mid + 1; i++) {
            // Update the counts by removing the leftmost character and adding the rightmost character
            if (answerKey[i - 1] == 'F') {
                countOfFalse--;
            } else {
                countOfTrue--;
            }
            if (answerKey[i + mid - 1] == 'F') {
                countOfFalse++;
            } else {
                countOfTrue++;
            }

            // Check if the number of changes needed is within the limit
            if (min(countOfTrue, countOfFalse) <= k) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false; // Return false if it is not possible to have a valid consecutive sequence of length 'mid'
    }
};
```

**Approach:**
- The given code uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the operation at most 'k' times.
- The `maxConsecutiveAnswers()` function takes the original answer key and the maximum number of changes 'k' as parameters.
- It initializes variables `low` and `high` to store the minimum and maximum possible lengths of consecutive 'T's or 'F's, respectively.
- It also initializes `ans` to store the maximum consecutive count.
- It performs binary search to find the maximum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's:
  - In each iteration, it calculates the `mid` length as the average of `low` and `high`.
  - It then checks if it is possible to have a valid consecutive sequence of length `mid` by calling the `isValid()` function.
  - If it is valid, it updates the lower bound (`low = mid + 1`) and stores the current answer (`ans = mid`).
  - If it is not valid, it updates the upper bound (`high = mid - 1`).
- Finally, it returns the maximum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's.

**Complexity analysis:**
- The time complexity of the code is `O(nlog n)`, where n is the length of the answer key. This is because we use binary search to find the maximum length.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we use a constant amount of extra space to store the variables.
