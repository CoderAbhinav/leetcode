# [137. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)
### `Medium`

Given an integer array `nums` whereevery element appears **three times**  except for one, which appears **exactly once** . Find the single element and return it.

You mustimplement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and useonly constantextra space.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Each element in `nums` appears exactly **three times**  except for one element which appears **once** .

**Solution:**
```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * Find the single element in the given integer array where every other element appears three times.
     *
     * @param nums  The input integer array.
     * @return      The single element that appears exactly once.
     */
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Array to store the count of set bits at each position
        int bitcount[32];

        // Initialize bitcount array with zeros
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            bitcount[i] = 0;
        }

        // Count the number of set bits at each position for all elements in nums
        for (auto n : nums) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
                // Check if the i-th bit is set in n
                if (1 << i & n)
                    bitcount[i]++;
            }
        }

        // Result variable to store the single element
        int res = 0;

        // Construct the single element by setting the i-th bit if the count is not divisible by 3
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if (bitcount[i] % 3 == 1) {
                res = res | (1 << i);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**
- Let `n` be the length of the input array `nums`.
- The time complexity of the `singleNumber()` function is `O(n)`, as it iterates over the array once and performs operations that take constant time.
- The space complexity is `O(1)`, as the function uses a fixed-size array `bitcount` and a single integer variable `res` to store the result.

**Explanation:**
- The given code finds the single element in the given integer array `nums`, where every other element appears three times.
- The `singleNumber()` function takes the input array `nums` and returns the single element that appears exactly once.
- The function uses an array `bitcount` of size 32 to store the count of set bits at each position (from 0 to 31) in the binary representation of the elements.
- Initially, the `bitcount` array is initialized with zeros.
- The function then iterates over each element `n` in `nums` and counts the number of set bits at each position by performing bitwise AND operations with a mask of 1 shifted to the respective position.
- After counting the set bits for all elements, the function constructs the single element by setting the bits at positions where the count in `bitcount` is not divisible by 3.
- Finally, the function returns the constructed single element.

Note: This solution works for any integer range as it counts the set bits at each position independently.
