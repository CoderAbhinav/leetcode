# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/)
### `Medium`

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that you **must**  take course `b<sub>i</sub>` first if you want to take course `a<sub>i</sub>`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique** .

**Solution:**

```CPP
/**
 * This code solves the course scheduling problem using a topological sorting approach.
 * Given the number of courses and their prerequisites, it determines if all courses can be finished.
 * It builds a directed graph, counts the in-degrees of each vertex, and performs topological sorting.
 * If all courses can be finished, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

**Approach:**
1. Build a directed graph using the prerequisites array.
2. Count the in-degrees of each vertex in the graph.
3. Find the vertex with the minimum in-degree (i.e., no prerequisites) and enqueue it.
4. Repeat until all vertices are visited or no vertex has a zero in-degree:
   - Dequeue a vertex, mark it as visited, and reduce the in-degrees of its adjacent vertices.
   - If any adjacent vertex becomes a zero in-degree, enqueue it.
5. Check if all vertices are visited. If yes, return true; otherwise, return false.

**The code performs the following steps:**
1. Builds the graph and counts the in-degrees.
2. Finds the vertex with the minimum in-degree (starting point for topological sort).
3. Enqueues all vertices with zero in-degree and marks them as visited.
4. Performs topological sort using a queue and updates in-degrees.
5. Verifies if all vertices are visited and returns the result.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- The code has a time complexity of `O(V + E)`, where V is the number of vertices (numCourses) and E is the number of edges (prerequisites).
- The space complexity is `O(V)`, which is used for the graph, in-degrees, and visited set.
