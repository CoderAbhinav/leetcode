# [1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)
### `Medium`

You are given an undirected weighted graph of`n`nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where`edges[i] = [a, b]`is an undirected edge connecting the nodes`a`and`b`with a probability of success of traversing that edge`succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes`start`and`end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from`start`to`end`and return its success probability.

If there is no path from`start`to`end`, **return0** . Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most **1e-5** .

**<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex1.png" style="width: 187px; height: 186px;">** 

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation:There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
```

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.30000
```

**Example 3:** 

**<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex3.png" style="width: 215px; height: 191px;">** 

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.00000
Explanation:There is no path between 0 and 2.
```

**Constraints:**

**Explanation**
1. The code defines a class named Solution that contains the function `maxProbability()`.

2. The `maxProbability()` function takes the following parameters:
   - `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
   - `edges`: A vector of vectors representing the edge list. Each inner vector [a, b] represents an undirected edge connecting nodes a and b.
   - `succProb`: A vector of doubles representing the probability of success for each edge in the edge list.
   - `start`: An integer representing the starting node.
   - `end`: An integer representing the destination node.

3. The code defines a helper function `buildADJList()` that builds an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given edge list and success probabilities.

4. Inside the `maxProbability()` function:
   - The adjacency list is built using the buildADJList() function.
   - A vector named `prob` is initialized with `INT_MIN` values to store the maximum success probability for each node. The probability of the start node is set to 0.
   - A priority queue named `pq` is created to store the nodes with their respective success probabilities. The start node is inserted with a probability of 0.
   - The code enters a while loop until the priority queue is empty.
   - In each iteration, the node with the highest success probability is extracted from the priority queue.
   - For each adjacent node, if the calculated success probability is greater than the current probability stored in the `prob` vector, it is updated and the node is pushed into the priority queue.
   - Finally, the success probability of the end node is computed by exponentiating the probability stored in the `prob` vector.
   - The computed success probability is returned as the result.

Complexity:
- The `buildADJList()` function has a time complexity of `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges in the graph, as it iterates over the edge list to construct the adjacency list.
- The `maxProbability()` function uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, resulting in a time complexity of `O((V + E) log V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
- Overall, the code has a time complexity of `O((V + E) log V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
