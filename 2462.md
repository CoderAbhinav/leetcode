# [2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/description/)
### `Medium`

You are given a **0-indexed**  integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `i^th` worker.

You are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:

- You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
- In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.

- For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2]` and `candidates = 2`, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4^th` worker because they have the lowest cost `[3,2,7,7,**1** ,2]`.
- In the second hiring session, we will choose `1^st` worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4^th` worker but they have the smallest index `[3,**2** ,7,7,2]`. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.

- If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
- A worker can only be chosen once.

Return the total cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
Output: 11
Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
The total hiring cost is 11.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
The total hiring cost is 4.
```
