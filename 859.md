# [859. Buddy Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/buddy-strings/description/)
### `Easy`

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` if you can swap two letters in `s` so the result is equal to `goal`, otherwise, return `false`.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.

**Solution:**

```CPP
class Solution {
    // Helper function to build a character frequency map for a given string
    map<char, int> buildMap(string& s) {
        map<char, int> ans;
        for (auto c : s)
            ans[c]++;
        return ans;
    }

public:
    /**
     * Determine if it is possible to swap two letters in string s to obtain string goal.
     *
     * @param s     The input string s.
     * @param goal  The target string goal.
     * @return      True if swapping two letters in s can result in goal, False otherwise.
     */
    bool buddyStrings(string s, string goal) {
        // If the lengths of s and goal are different, it's not possible to obtain goal by swapping letters in s
        if (s.length() != goal.length())
            return false;

        // Build frequency maps for both s and goal
        map<char, int> s_map = buildMap(s), goal_map = buildMap(goal);

        // If the frequency maps of s and goal are equal
        if (s_map == goal_map) {
            // If s and goal are equal, there should be at least one character that occurs more than once
            if (s == goal) {
                for (auto p : s_map) {
                    if (p.second > 1)
                        return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
            // If s and goal are not equal, there should be exactly two different characters at different positions
            else {
                int diff = 0, n = s.length(), prev = -1;

                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    if (s[i] != goal[i]) {
                        diff++;
                        // If more than two differences are found, it's not possible to obtain goal by swapping letters in s
                        if (diff == 2) {
                            if (s[prev] != goal[i] || s[i] != goal[prev])
                                return false;
                        }
                        prev = i;
                    }
                }

                // There should be exactly two differences in order to obtain goal by swapping letters in s
                return diff == 2;
            }
        }

        // If the frequency maps of s and goal are not equal, it's not possible to obtain goal by swapping letters in s
        return false;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**
- Let `n` be the length of the input strings `s` and `goal`.
- The time complexity of the `buddyStrings()` function is O(n), as it iterates over the strings once and performs operations that take constant time.
- The space complexity is O(n), as the function uses two maps to store the frequency of characters in the strings.

**Explanation:**
- The given code determines whether it is possible to swap two letters in string `s` to obtain string `goal`.
- The `buddyStrings()` function takes two strings `s` and `goal` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the swap is possible.
- The function first checks if the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different. If they are different, it's not possible to obtain `goal` by swapping letters in `s`, so it returns `false`.
- The function then builds frequency maps for both `s` and `goal` using the `buildMap()` helper function. The frequency map stores the count of each character in the string.
- If the frequency maps of `s` and `goal` are equal, it checks two cases:
  - If `s` and `goal` are equal, there should be at least one character that
