# [230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/description/)
### `Medium`

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the `k^th` smallest value (**1-indexed** ) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree1.jpg" style="width: 212px; height: 301px;">

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg" style="width: 382px; height: 302px;">

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

**Follow up:**  If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

Docstrings for the given code:

```CPP
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
    /**
     * Helper function to find the kth smallest element in a binary search tree.
     *
     * @param root The root of the binary search tree.
     * @param k    The value of k indicating the kth smallest element to find.
     * @param ans  The variable to store the kth smallest element.
     */
    void helper(TreeNode* root, int& k, int& ans) {
        if (root == nullptr) return;

        helper(root->left, k, ans);
        k--;
        if (k == 0) ans = root->val;
        helper(root->right, k, ans);
    }

public:
    /**
     * Find the kth smallest element in a binary search tree.
     *
     * @param root The root of the binary search tree.
     * @param k    The value of k indicating the kth smallest element to find.
     * @return     The kth smallest element.
     */
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        helper(root, k, ans);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**
- Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary search tree.
- The time complexity of the `kthSmallest()` function is O(n) since it traverses each node of the binary search tree exactly once.
- The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the recursive calls on the stack.

**Explanation:**
- The given code finds the kth smallest element in a binary search tree (BST).
- The `kthSmallest()` function takes the root of the BST and the value of k as input and returns the kth smallest element.
- It initializes a variable `ans` to store the kth smallest element.
- The function calls the helper function `helper()` to perform an in-order traversal of the BST.
- The `helper()` function recursively traverses the BST in an in-order fashion (left subtree, current node, right subtree).
- At each step, it decrements the value of `k` to keep track of the remaining elements to traverse.
- When `k` becomes 0, it means the current node is the kth smallest element, and the value of that node is stored in `ans`.
- The in-order traversal ensures that the elements are visited in ascending order.
- Finally, the function returns the value stored in `ans`, which represents the kth smallest element in the BST.
